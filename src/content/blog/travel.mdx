### hey there!

I've written a guide here about how I book the cheapest flights possible. This guide is focussed on finding the cheapest **ONE WAY** fares with budget airlines.

<br />
### 1. Go to [kiwi.com](https://www.kiwi.com/)

kiwi.com has the best search engine for flights in my opinion. It is very easy to use and you can find the cheapest flights in no time. Another search engine I can highly recommend is the [Ryanair discovery app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ryanair.discovery), which is only available on android. This app however only shows flights from Ryanair.

### 2. Choose a range of several days for the departure if possible.

This will increase your chances of finding a cheap flight. If you are flexible with your dates, you can choose the option "anytime" in the date picker. This will show you the cheapest flights for the next 6 months.

### 3. Enter your departure point(s) and destination(s) or choose "anywhere".

Type whole city names, some cities have multiple airports and choosing a city instead of a specific airport will increase your chances of finding a cheap flight. If you type in a city name, kiwi.com will show you the option to add city + 250KM. This will show you flights from all airports within 250KM of the city you have chosen. If you want a closer radius, you can change the url

```bash
https://www.kiwi.com/search/tiles/{city}-{country}-{radius}km/anywhere/anytime/no-return
```

### 4. Think about whether you need to bring a suitcase.

with every budget airline you are allowed to bring a small bag (usually 40x20x25cm) for free. If you need to bring a suitcase, you can add it in the filters. If you are not sure whether you need a suitcase add one anyway, because when you need to add one later it will be more expensive.

### 5. Hit seach and choose the best option for you.

on the left side of the page there are a lot of filters you can use to find the best flight for you. I usually choose "direct flights only". It's a lot more risky to book a flight with a layover you found here, because the options shown here do not always have a guaranteed connection. If you are ok with a layover but don't want to take any risk turn off "self transfer" in the filters. This will only show you flights with a guaranteed connection.

### 6. Steps to take after you have found a flight.

DON'T book the flight yet. First go through the flowchart below to check if you can find the same flight cheaper somewhere else. If you've gone through the flowchart you can be sure you have found the cheapest flight possible!
