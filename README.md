# Portfolio Site

This is my personal portfolio site showcasing my projects, skills, and experiences. It is built using modern web technologies to provide an engaging and user-friendly experience. The site incorporates data from various APIs to enhance its functionality.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js (v13) with App Router: Next.js is a React framework that allows for server-side rendering, static site generation, and client-side rendering. App Router provides a better syntax for writing and handling front- and back-end code.

- Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-defined styles and classes to streamline the styling process and ensure consistency across the site.

- Vercel is a cloud platform that provides hosting, deployment, and management. Itâ€™s the easiest way to host a Nextjs site.

- TypeScript: TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that brings static typing and improved tooling to the development process. It helps catch errors early and provides better code documentation and autocompletion.

## APIs Used

- GitHub API: The GitHub API is utilized to fetch my github statistics

- Wakatime API: The Wakatime API integration provides insights into my coding activity and productivity.

- Own api for google maps location retrieval using [locationsharinglib](https://github.com/costastf/locationsharinglib), hosted on [DigitalOcean Functions](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/functions)

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pnpm install`.
3. Setup your own [locationsharinglib api](https://github.com/costastf/locationsharinglib)
4. Obtain API keys for the GitHub API, Wakatime API, Mapbox, and if used digital ocean functions X-Require-Whisk-Auth
5. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys as environment variables:
   ```
   MY_SECRET_TOKEN=your_api_revalidate_token (just generate a random token)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token
   DO_KEY=your_digital_ocean_function_X-Require-Whisk-Auth_key
   WAKATIME_KEY=your_wakatime_api_key
   GITHUB_KEY=your_github_api_key
   ```
6. Start the development server with `pnpm dev`.
7. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the portfolio site in action.
